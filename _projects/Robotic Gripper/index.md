title: Robotic Gripper
description:  Designed and manufactured a robotic gripper using Fusion 360, integrating a geared mechanical transmission and 3D-printed components. The system is actuated via an Arduino-controlled motor driver, allowing precise motion control for grasping and releasing objects. This project demonstrates the intersection of mechanical design, embedded electronics, and control programming in a compact robotic subsystem. The design was inspired by observing larger, high-precision, industrial-grade grippers at a robotics conference, motivating a cost-effective, scaled-down version.
