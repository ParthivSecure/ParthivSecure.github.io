  I enjoy building and refining engineering systems, especially projects where I can move from an idea to a working, tested solution. I’m motivated by hands-on work that involves experimenting, troubleshooting, and learning through iteration. My interests include embedded systems, electronics, and control applications. Through coursework and personal projects, I have gained experience with system integration, debugging, and applying engineering theory to practical, real-world designs.
